# WHATEVER

*“Tonight is all about starting over.”*

When I saw her leave from the car's mirror, I knew it would be hard for us to see each other again. I've known her since I was 16. I still remember her silence when I met her for the first time. And also, I remember the hair she coiled up for me. I remember everything. How I wish I hadn't expressed my love. Perhaps, as Salinger said, love is a touch and yet not a touch. I know I'm gonna miss her, I know I'm full of regrets, but I don't know what to do. I just went home and started learning new things again.
